The stateless rate-limiting (service 
 or [endpoint](/docs/endpoints/rate-limit/) types) is the recommended approach for almost all scenarios. As the API Gateway does not have any centralization, **the limits apply individually to each running instance of Pucora**.

Working in a cluster implies applying the limits taking into account the deployment size. For instance, if you want to use a limit of 100 reqs/s in a specific endpoint, the configuration will need to consider the number of nodes in the cluster.

Let's say that you have a cluster deployed with three instances of Pucora. If you write a `max_rate=100` in the configuration, your ecosystem is limiting to 300 reqs/s in total as three servers are receiving balanced traffic.

When you have to do small math like this, through the [Flexible Configuration](/docs/configuration/flexible-config/), you might inject environment variables when starting Pucora with the total number of machines you have. For instance:

```tpl
{
    "endpoint": "/limited-endpoint",
    "extra_config": {
      "qos/ratelimit/router": {
          "max_rate": {{ env "NUM_PODS" | div 100 }}
        }
    }
}
```

You can execute pucora like this:



**Term**

```bash
FC_ENABLE=1 \
FC_OUT=compiled.json \
NUM_PODS=3 pucora check -c pucora.json
```


And you get in the compiled.json the following content:

```json
{
    "endpoint": "/limited-endpoint",
    "extra_config": {
      "qos/ratelimit/router": {
          "max_rate": 33
        }
    }
}
```
